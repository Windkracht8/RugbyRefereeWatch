# RugbyRefereeWatch

Track match time, score, cards for Wear OS and Garmin watches.
The app for the watch works stand-alone, with the companion phone app you can pull the match report to your phone and prepare match settings on your phone.

## Apple phones and watches

Developing and publishing Apple apps is not fee of charge. Apple charges a fee of 99 USD per year to publish and maintain an app, plus you need to own or rent a Macbook. To cover these costs I have started a fundraiser. If you are interested in getting this app on Apple devices, or just want to support me, consider donating:

## Samsung Galaxy watch 3 and older (Tizen)

Samsung has stopped support for Tizen, it is no longer possible to update the app in the Galaxy store. If you have such a watch and the app installed on it, it won't connect to the latest version of the phone app in the Google Play store.
