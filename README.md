# Samsung Galaxy watch 3 and older (Tizen)
Samsung has stopped support for Tizen, it is no longer possible to update the app in the Galaxy store. If you have such a watch and the app installed on it, it won't connect to the latest version of the phone app in the Google Play store.
Option 1 (harder)
This is the harder option because it requires you to install the Tizen IDE and install over the debug channel.
Install version 3.0.1 on your watch manually. You can download the file here, it is called Tizen-301.wgt in the folder Tizen.
Option 2 (easier)
This is easier because you can install from an apk with Android when you give it permission.
Install an old version of the phone app manually. You can download the file here, it is called Android-240.apk in the folder Tizen.
Option 3 (expensive)
Buy a newer Wear OS based watch, and install from the Google Play store.
